=== LUBOMETER FORMULA (How your scores are used) ===

Step 1: Raw Score (Per Indicator) - You provide scores 1-10 for each indicator
Step 2: Average Per Pillar - Indicator scores are averaged within each pillar
Step 3: Reverse Score P6 - Price Sensitivity is reversed (11 - Raw Score)
Step 4: Weighted Pillar Score:
  - P1 (Pain & Desire) × 1.5 ← MOST IMPORTANT
  - P2 (Urgency) × 1.0
  - P3 (Decisiveness) × 1.0
  - P4 (Money) × 1.5 ← MOST IMPORTANT
  - P5 (Responsibility) × 1.0
  - P6 (Price Sensitivity) × 1.0 (after reverse)
  - P7 (Trust) × 1.0
Step 5: Total Score = Sum of weighted pillars (max = 90)
Step 6: Apply Truth Index Penalties for incoherence
Step 7: Final Lubometer Score = Total - Penalties

READINESS ZONES:
  70-90 → ✅ GREEN: High Buy Probability - Push to close
  50-69 → ⚠️ YELLOW: Moderate - Needs coaching
  30-49 → 🧊 RED: Risk or resistance - Slow down
  <30 → ❌ NO-GO: Do not close

CLOSE BLOCKER RULES:
  Rule 1: P1 ≤ 6 AND P2 ≤ 5 → ❌ Not enough pain or urgency
  Rule 2: P6 raw ≥ 7 AND P4 ≤ 5 → ❌ High price sensitivity + low money

TRUTH INDEX PENALTIES (deducted from score):
  - High Pain (P1 ≥ 7) + Low Urgency (P2 ≤ 4) → -15 points
  - High Desire + Low Decisiveness (P3 ≤ 4) → -15 points
  - High Money (P4 ≥ 7) + High Price Sensitivity (P6 ≥ 8) → -10 points
  - Claims Authority + Reveals Need for Approval → -10 points
  - High Desire + Low Responsibility (P5 ≤ 5) → -15 points

=== THE 7 PILLARS AND 27 INDICATORS ===

PILLAR 1: Perceived Spread (Pain & Desire Gap) - WEIGHT 1.5x
  1. Pain Intensity: How severe is their pain? (1=minor, 10=overwhelming)
  2. Pain Awareness: Do they understand root cause? (1=unclear, 10=deep understanding)
  3. Desire Clarity: How specific is their desired outcome? (1=vague, 10=vivid vision)
  4. Desire Priority: How important is solving this? (1=not urgent, 10=top priority)

PILLAR 2: Urgency - WEIGHT 1.0x

PILLAR 3: Decisiveness - WEIGHT 1.0x
  9. Decision Authority: Are they the final decision maker? (1=needs approval, 10=full authority)
  10. Decision Style: How do they decide? (1=very slow, 10=fast intuitive)
  11. Commitment to Decide: Ready to commit today? (1=wants to wait, 10=ready now)
  12. Self-Permission: Can they give themselves permission? (1=overthinks, 10=trusts self)

PILLAR 4: Available Money - WEIGHT 1.5x
  13. Resource Access: Do they have funds available? (1=no funds, 10=readily available)
  14. Resource Fluidity: Can they move/reallocate funds? (1=tied up, 10=flexible)
  15. Investment Mindset: See it as investment vs cost? (1=cost mindset, 10=investment mindset)
  16. Resourcefulness: History of finding money when committed? (1=never, 10=always figures it out)

PILLAR 5: Responsibility & Ownership - WEIGHT 1.0x
  17. Problem Recognition: Acknowledge their role? (1=blames others, 10=owns it)
  18. Solution Ownership: Taking responsibility to change? (1=waiting for rescue, 10=it's on me)
  19. Locus of Control: Believe they control outcomes? (1=external factors, 10=I control it)
  20. Integrity: Desire vs Action: Alignment between wants and actions? (1=no alignment, 10=strong alignment)

PILLAR 6: Price Sensitivity (REVERSE SCORED) - WEIGHT 1.0x
  21. Emotional Response to Spending: Anxiety about investment? (1=not anxious, 10=very anxious)
  22. Negotiation Reflex: Always negotiating? (1=accepts price, 10=always negotiates)
  23. Structural Rigidity: Needs control over terms? (1=flexible, 10=rigid)
  NOTE: For P6, LOW scores (1-3) are GOOD (low sensitivity), HIGH scores (7-10) are BAD

PILLAR 7: Trust - WEIGHT 1.0x
  24. ROI Ownership: Understands ROI depends on their action? (1=expects guarantee, 10=owns ROI)
  25. External Trust: Trust in provider/offer? (1=skeptical, 10=trusts)
  26. Internal Trust: Trust in own follow-through? (1=doubts self, 10=trusts self)
  27. Risk Tolerance: Willing to take calculated risks? (1=plays safe, 10=takes risks)

=== SCORING RULES ===
- Score generously (7-9) when signals are clearly present
- P1 and P4 have 1.5x weight - score these carefully as they impact lubometer most
- For P6 (Price Sensitivity): LOW scores are GOOD (they're not price sensitive)
- Focus on PROSPECT statements, not salesperson
- Score indicators you can clearly identify from the conversation

- Red flag: emotional words but no action orientation

T2: High Desire + Low Decisiveness  
- Wants change badly but avoids making decisions
- Red flag: "I want this so much" + "I need to think about it more"

T3: High Money + High Price Sensitivity
- Has money available but still resists price
- Red flag: "I have the money" + "can you lower the price"

T4: Claims Authority + Needs Approval
- Says they decide but reveals needing partner approval
- Red flag: "I'm the decision maker" + "I'll need to ask my wife"

T5: High Desire + Low Responsibility
- Wants results but doesn't take ownership
- Red flag: "I want this outcome" + blames external factors

T6: High Commitment + External Blame
- Claims ready to commit but blames external factors
- Red flag: "I'm ready" + "if only X would change"

- Pain + Urgency aligned
